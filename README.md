Fragmentor is a mass spectrometry tool used to predict the masses of protein and peptide fragments. The main purpose of the program is to generate a list of fragments that could be produced in a CID or PD/CID experiment given the starting sequence and the modifications made to the amino acids in the sequence. This program attempts to account for radical processes in peptide fragmentation such as side chain loss. This is useful in interpreting mass spectra where radicals are known to be formed.

Fragmentor was originally created by Ben Moore for the Julian Group at the University of California Riverside in 2008. The original version was written in C# using the .NET framework. It has now been migrated to R/Shiny. If there are bugs or mistakes in the program please send an email to ryan.julian@ucr.edu so that they can be corrected.
